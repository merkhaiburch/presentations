With the onset of climate change, developing crop varieties adapted to future environments is paramount in maintaining plant productivity. Breeding a crop like Zea mays (Lakota - wagmìza or maize) for future environments requires that we understand how all ~35,000 genes are regulated in the genome. In the 1950s, Barbara McClintock hypothesized that transposable elements - so-called “jumping genes” - could be responsible for controlling gene activity and could lead to the specialized evolution and adaptation of gene regulatory grammar in their host genomes. We now know that genes are heavily impacted by the nearly 350,000 transposable elements that comprise 85% of the wagmìza genome sequence. We hypothesize that transposable elements have played a key role in adaptation to new environments and, on a smaller scale, provided an abundant source of regulatory information that can impact gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used gene expression data from nearly 400 wagmìza varieties and 600 wild relatives related to wagmìza. We built models that quantify how transposable elements impact gene regulation and adaptation to new environments. We identify numerous transposable element insertions regulating or disrupting gene expression, enriched transposable-element derived motifs in environmentally responsive genes, and describe other genomic features associated with these expression changes. These patterns can guide plant breeders on how to design high-yielding wagmìza varieties more suited to new environments and conditions.
