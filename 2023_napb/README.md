Agriculture relies on plant breeding and genetics to deliver the best crop varieties and agronomic practices to deploy results across nearly a billion hectares of cropland. We regularly see industry delivering on this objective, although optimized for their goals and limited geographies. However, many public sector efforts that feed most of the planet are not meeting these objectives or working effectively across disciplines. A key example is repeated publications on single genes, multiple gene constructs, or similar edits that claim to confer incredible yield increases. Many of these publications are flawed in how they measure and report yield. Often, they lack replication across environments, have low sample sizes, compare yield estimates in non-commercially competitive germplasm, and report on experiment-specific yields that massively underperform as compared to local or global yields. Here, we detail how the plant breeding community can explain common issues in yield testing experiments so that the greater scientific community and the peer review process can catch misleading results early on. 

The common issues that need to be explained differently to unfamiliar communities when evaluating the impact of single genes on crop yield include the following:
•	Robustly measure crop-relevant yield, not plant-level yield.
•	Create field designs that pay attention to plant competition and genotype-by-environment interactions.
•	Use elite germplasm.
•	Prioritize genes that evolution may have missed or whose variation has been exhausted within elite germplasm.
•	Develop collaborations and use public sector frameworks such as the Genome to Fields Initiative to test changes at scale.

Accurate measurement and reporting of crop productivity have drastic consequences for feeding the planet. With the onset of climate change and the degradation of Land and water supplies, there is no more important time to collaborate as a community to accurately measure, improve, and deliver on crop resilience and yield.
